    ___ WHAT IS IT? ______________________________

    ev3dev-c is a C library for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Debian Linux
    (http://www.ev3dev.org/) which wraps an access to the EV3 hardware.

    The library also supports a remote access to the EV3 brick over UDP.
    So, if you configure WLAN on the brick you can control the EV3
    hardware from a remote computer, for instance, running under Windows.

    ___                 __________________________
    ___ OTHER LANGUAGES __________________________

    Python (see "python/ev3dev" folder), Ruby (see "ruby" folder) and
    Perl (see "perl" folder) libraries are automatically generated from
    C library using SWIG tool.

    Use pip to install ev3dev-c Python package:

        pip install --pre ev3dev-c

    ev3dev-c is currently in a beta stage, therefore you have to use
    the key "--pre".

    Python package contains the following binary modules:
    _ev3.pyd    – for a remote access under Windows (x86);
    _ev3.so     – for LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Debian.

    You have to install "python-dev", "ruby-dev" and "libperl-dev"
    packages to build the corresponding library.
