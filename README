    ___ WHAT IS IT? ______________________________

    ev3dev-c is a C library for LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Debian
    (http://www.ev3dev.org/) which wraps access to EV3 hardware.

    The library supports remote access to EV3 board over UDP.
    So, it's possible to run EV3 programs on another machine,
    e.g. under Windows, if you have set up WLAN of course...

    The library is written using yupp C preprocessor, but
    generated source files in C also included.


    COMING SOON... ))
