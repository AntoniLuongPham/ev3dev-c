    ev3dev-c is a C library for LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Debian
    (http://www.ev3dev.org/) which wraps access to the EV3 hardware.

    The library also supports remote access to the EV3 board over UDP.
    So, it's possible to drive the EV3 hardware from your computer,
    e.g. under Windows, if you have set up WLAN of course.
