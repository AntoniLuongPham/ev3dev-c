    ___ WHAT IS IT? ______________________________

    ev3_link is a part of ev3dev-c library which provides your program
    with remote access to the EV3 brick over UDP.
    Also ev3_link is used as a stand-alone program (server) on the EV3 brick
    to handle requests from a remote computer (client).

    ___        ___________________________________
    ___ SERVER ___________________________________

    ev3_link server must be running on the brick to drive the EV3 hardware
    remotely.
    There are makefile in "source/ev3/ev3_link" folder to build the server.

    * * *  How to automatically start ev3_link server on boot?

    > cd ev3dev-c/
    > sudo cp source/ev3/ev3_link/ev3_link_d /etc/init.d/
    > sudo cp source/ev3/ev3_link/ev3_link /usr/local/sbin/
    > sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/ev3_link_d
    > sudo update-rc.d ev3_link_d defaults

    * * *  How to set WLAN up on the EV3 brick?

    ___        ___________________________________
    ___ CLIENT ___________________________________

    The remote access to the EV3 brick is implied when you build a program
    under Windows or Linux (not on __ARM_ARCH_4T__).

    Approximately every 5 seconds the broadcast message is sent by the server
    on port 8800 (or specified when the server starts). The client detects
    the IP address of the server catching a message like that.

    Also you can specify the IP address before the brick initialization.

    #include "ev3.h"

#ifndef __ARM_ARCH_4T__
    ev3_brick_addr = "192.168.0.204";

#endif

    ev3_init();

    The interchange protocol is described on
